    <div class="card-panel yellow accent-2 red-text text-darken-2"> Hi!

The Smriti portal is currently closed. Thank you for participating and hope you enjoyed the experience of Smriti-ing! :)<br>

Printed personalized edition of Smriti 2016 will be given out. This will consist of:<br>
1) A yearbook with photos of each person of our batch with name and branch.<br>
2) class group photo with names of each individual as sent by CRs.<br>
3) group photos of trips and events sent by CRs to us<br>

The above 3 will be printed in 100 GSM paper (shoreline type)<br>

 4) A hard cover of 250 GSM.<br>
5)Apart from this all the testimonials you received will also be printed thus making your copy individualized for you in 130 GSM thick certificate type paper.<br>

Cost: Rs.295 if more than 500 people are interested and Rs.348 otherwise. Tried our best to reduce but since it is personalised, the digital printing costs and binding increases significantly. <br>

Collection can be done by you or your friends from Thursday (May 5th) evening onwards or anytime when you come to college (including convocation).Â <br>

Please note the website will be down by May 10th and if you would like a permanent copy of all the memories shared to you by your friends, please fill the form below. <br>
